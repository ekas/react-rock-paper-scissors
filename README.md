## Project Local Build Instructions

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) & [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekas/react-todo
```

You should now see a `react-todo` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd react-todo/
```

- Step 2: Frontend Build Instructions. Install dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend/
yarn install
```

This will use `yarn` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Start the frontend project.

```bash
yarn start
```

This will run a local instance of the application `http://localhost:3000/`

- Step 4: BAckend Build Instructions. Install dependencies.

Open a new terminal and enter following command.

```bash
cd backend/
yarn install
```

- Step 4: Start the backend project.
